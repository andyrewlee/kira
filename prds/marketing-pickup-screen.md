## SEO
- Title: Pickup Screen for Square — Live Order Boards Customers Love
- Meta: Delight guests with live order boards powered by Square—clear, branded displays with optional voice callouts so lines move faster and fewer people ask for status.

## Design Direction

- White space: roomy columns and gutters; avoid cramped lists.
- Shapes: bordered tiles with rounded corners; gentle offset shadows; perforation or dashed separators.
- Motion: subtle “flip to Finished” animation preview (quick fade/slide), not constant loops.
- Accessibility: color contrast and large hit areas in examples.
