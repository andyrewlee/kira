## SEO
- Title: Custom Website for Square — Accurate Pages, Built Fast
- Meta: Generate an accurate, fast website grounded in your Square data—hours, menu, and locations—so customers and AI assistants always get the right info.

## Design Direction
- Editorial feel: generous margins, big typographic hierarchy, and clean grids.
- Typography: `Geist Mono` section labels + large headlines; `Geist` for readable body and FAQs.
- Shapes: bordered mock pages, browser chrome bars, and offset card shadows.
- Visual motifs: SEO schema badges, lightning‑fast icons, location cards with maps.
- Rhythm: 72–96px between sections; 16–24px padding within cards; consistent dotted rules.

## Section Styles & Variation (must‑haves)
- Use at least 8 distinct section patterns. Avoid repeating box grids back‑to‑back.
- Patterns to include: split hero + browser mock; perforation divider; 2‑column outcome “tickets”; alternating text/visual zig‑zag; full‑bleed callout band; location card row (borders); list rows with only rules (no boxes); step tiles with oversized numbers; minimalist FAQ.
- Typography: swing between oversized mono headlines and compact label caps; change scale between adjacent sections.
- Neobrutalism: 2px borders + offset shadows used differently per section (e.g., mock browser vs. small tickets).
- White space first: allow airy sections with just type and thin rules to break up heavy visuals.
